# SplendidCRM Enterprise Edition
## Get Started

The quickest way to get started is to request our installer. The installer will do practically everything you need to get a Splendid App Builder site up and running, with the exception of installing SQL Server Express. Or, you can download the latest from GitHub and build the app yourself.
